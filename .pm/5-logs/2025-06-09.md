# Daily Log - June 9, 2025

## Goals
- [x] Complete Phase 1 Foundation & Core Architecture
- [x] Implement remaining TODO items in providers
- [x] Set up this project as a Project Pilot project (dogfooding)
- [x] Test all implemented functionality

## Progress
- âœ… **ProjectTreeProvider**: Implemented actual folder content reading with file system integration
- âœ… **TaskProvider**: Complete implementation of task file manipulation (add/edit/toggle tasks)  
- âœ… **MarkdownParser Integration**: Full CRUD operations for tasks in markdown files
- âœ… **ProjectService Enhancement**: Added task and log loading during project refresh
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Set up this project using Project Pilot structure in `.pm/`
- âœ… **Configuration**: Created `project-pilot.json` config for this project
- âœ… **Documentation**: Updated all project files (STATUS.md, tasks.md, timeline.md)
- âœ… **Build System**: All code compiles without errors, ESLint warnings fixed

## Technical Achievements

### File System Integration
- Real directory scanning in TreeView with proper file/folder hierarchy
- Task count indicators for markdown files
- Asynchronous folder expansion with error handling

### Task Management Implementation  
- **Add Tasks**: Full implementation with section selection and file writing
- **Toggle Tasks**: Real markdown file modification with checkbox state changes
- **Edit Tasks**: In-place text editing with line-based file updates
- **Navigation**: Jump to task location in source files
- **Refresh System**: Automatic project data reload after task modifications

### Project Detection & Loading
- Enhanced detection with `.pm` directory structure
- Automatic task aggregation from configured files and all markdown files
- Real-time file watching and project refresh
- Proper error handling and fallback strategies

## Architecture Improvements
- Clean separation between providers, services, and models
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Error handling with user feedback
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Testing & Validation
- âœ… Extension builds and packages successfully
- âœ… All TypeScript types check correctly  
- âœ… ESLint passes with no warnings
- âœ… Command registration and activation working
- âœ… File watching and real-time updates functional

## Project Management Meta-Achievement
- **Dogfooding Success**: This project now uses its own Project Pilot structure
- Created comprehensive `.pm/` directory with:
  - 0-planning/ (PRD, implementation plan)
  - 1-research/ (API documentation, methodology research)
  - 2-assets/ (extension assets and design resources)
  - 3-development/ (phase tracking and implementation notes)
  - 4-deliverables/ (empty, ready for releases)
  - 5-logs/ (this log and future daily logs)
  - STATUS.md, tasks.md, timeline.md with real project data

## Notes
- Phase 1 is now **fully functional** for basic project management
- All TODO items from Phase 1.1 have been implemented
- The extension can now be used to manage projects with real task manipulation
- Ready to begin Phase 2: Project Initialization & Structure

## Blockers Resolved
- âœ… File manipulation for tasks (was placeholder, now functional)
- âœ… TreeView folder expansion (was empty, now reads real directories) 
- âœ… Project task loading (was missing, now fully implemented)
- âœ… Real-time refresh after task changes (now working via command system)

## Tomorrow (Next Phase)
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Project Initialization Wizard
- [ ] Implement template system for different project types
- [ ] Add context menus to TreeView for file/folder creation
- [ ] Enhanced directory navigation with project structure validation
- [ ] Test extension with multiple project types

## Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 6 core files enhanced with full implementations
- **New Functionality**: 100% of Phase 1 TODO items completed
- **Code Quality**: 0 errors, 0 warnings, full TypeScript compliance
- **Testing**: Extension ready for real-world usage

**Phase 1 Status**: ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
